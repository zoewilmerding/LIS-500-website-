		<h2> <strong>Implicit Bias</strong>:</h2>
	<p>Unconscious attitudes that influence our decisions.</p>
	<p>Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that unconsciously influence our actions, judgments, and interactions. Even people who strive to be fair and inclusive can unknowingly act on biases. Recognizing implicit bias is the first step; the harder part is actively working to counteract it through reflection, intentional practice, and structural change.</p>

		<h2> <strong>Intersectionality</strong>:</h2>
		<p>How overlapping identities (like race, gender, class) shape experiences.</p>
	<p> Intersectionality highlights how people’s identities overlap (race, gender, class, sexuality, ability, etc.), creating unique experiences of discrimination or privilege. Thinking intersectionally helps us move beyond “single-axis” views—for example, recognizing that a Black woman might face barriers differently than a Black man or a white woman. It’s a framework for understanding complexity and avoiding oversimplification when addressing inequality.</p>

		<h2> <strong>IBT/IAT</strong>:</h2>
	<p> A test that helps people reflect on their automatic associations.</p>
	<p>The IBT is designed to reveal unconscious associations we hold, often around race, gender, age, or other social categories. Taking it can be an eye-opening experience because it shows how bias operates below our awareness, shaping the way we interpret others and make decisions—even when we consciously reject stereotypes.</p>
