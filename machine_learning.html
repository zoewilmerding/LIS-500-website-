                <!-- Project Statement Paragraphs -->
                <p>Our goal for the machine learning project was to understand first-hand how machine learning models are built, trained, and how design choices impact the accuracy of the systems...</p>

                <p>After running into issues with the machine classifying the “neutral” emotion, we decided to incorporate clear, visible hand signals...</p>

                <p>After receiving feedback on our model, we realized there were many issues with having Amanda take every photo...</p>

                <p>We repeated the design cycle of collect, train, test, and adjust over and over until the machine was working just how we liked it...</p>

                <p>When designing our model, we quickly found that a neutral expression was nearly impossible for the machine to accurately identify...</p>

                <p>The process of creating the model made us extremely aware of the ethical decision-making behind AI development...</p>

                    <!-- Basic scope info -->
                    Classification: Determining Different Emotions <br>
                    Range: 3 Emotions <br>
                    Emotions Listed: Happy, Neutral, Sad <br>
                    Image Samples: 200-300 images for each classified item <br>

                <h2 id="title">Reflections On Our Project & Unmasking AI by Joy Bolumawani</h2>

                <!-- Reflection Paragraphs -->
                <p>Our machine learning technology teaches the computer how to recognize three basic facial expressions...</p>

                <p>We began by deciding which expressions to include. We chose happy, neutral, and sad...</p>

                <p>One concept from the book that we discussed was the idea of “Coded Gaze”...</p>

                <p>As Boulamwini discussed in her book, AI systems are never neutral, as every classification reflects a human decision...</p>

                <p>As we continued to test our model, we saw that the system confidently misclassified subtle expression differences...</p>

                <p>Building this small version of a machine learning tool prompted us to think critically about the ethical principles behind AI development...</p>
